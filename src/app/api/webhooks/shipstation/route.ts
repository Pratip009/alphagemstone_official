/**
 * POST /api/webhooks/shipstation?secret=...
 *
 * Registers as a ShipStation "Tracking Updated" webhook target
 * (Account Settings → Integration Partners → Webhooks → Add a Webhook,
 * or POST /v1/environments/webhooks — event: TRACK).
 *
 * This is what closes the loop that was missing before: without this route,
 * nothing in the app ever finds out a package was delivered, so orders sat
 * at "shipped" forever and customers/admins never got a "delivered" signal.
 *
 * ShipStation does not POST the full tracking payload — it POSTs a small
 * envelope with a `resource_url` you must GET (with your API key) to fetch
 * the actual data. We deliberately don't trust the webhook body for the
 * "is it delivered" decision — we just use it as a trigger, then re-fetch
 * canonical tracking info via trackShipEnginePackage() (the same function
 * the UI uses), and only update the order status if that live lookup
 * confirms `deliveredAt`.
 *
 * Auth: ShipStation's UI-configured webhooks can't attach custom headers
 * reliably, so we authenticate via a `secret` query param instead. Set
 * SHIPSTATION_WEBHOOK_SECRET in your env, and register the webhook target
 * URL as: https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/shipstation?secret=YOUR_SECRET
 *
 * We always return 200 for anything that isn't an auth failure — ShipStation
 * retries on non-2xx responses, and retrying "we didn't recognize this
 * payload" or "this label isn't in our DB" would just waste calls.
